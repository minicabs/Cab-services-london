      <!-- FAQ 1 -->
      <details class="bg-white p-5 rounded-lg shadow">
        <summary class="cursor-pointer font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800">
          1. How do I know if a taxi in London is licensed?
        </summary>
        <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          All licensed taxis and minicabs must display their Transport for London (TfL) license. You’ll usually see a roundel sticker on the windshield or a license plate on the rear. You can also ask the driver or check the company website for confirmation.
        </p>
      </details>

          2. Can I book a London cab in advance?
        </summary>
        <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Yes, most cab services in London allow you to pre-book rides online, through apps, or over the phone. Pre-booking is recommended for airport transfers, special events, or if you want a particular type of vehicle, like an executive car or wheelchair-accessible taxi.

          3. Are taxi cabs in London more expensive at night?
        </summary>
        <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Some licensed black cabs charge slightly higher fares during late-night hours, weekends, or holidays. However, many private hire taxi services offer fixed pricing regardless of the time. Always check fare policies before booking to avoid surprises.
        </p>

        <summary class="cursor-pointer font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800">
          4. Do London taxi services accept card payments?
        </summary>
        <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Yes, most modern taxi cabs in London accept card payments, including contactless and mobile wallets. However, it’s good practice to confirm with the driver or booking app ahead of time. Many services are now entirely cashless for your convenience.
        </p>

      <!-- FAQ 5 -->
      <details class="bg-white p-5 rounded-lg shadow">
        <summary class="cursor-pointer font-semibold text-lg text-gray-800">
          5. What’s the difference between a minicab and a black cab in London?
        </summary>
        <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Minicabs are private hire vehicles that must be pre-booked, while black cabs can be hailed directly on the street or at taxi ranks. Both are regulated and safe, but black cabs often cost more due to their metered fares and ability to respond to real-time demand.
